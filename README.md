Abstract

The widespread use of social media is often accompanied by negative impacts, mainly on the mental health of users.
The primary aim of this review is to present the characteristics of individuals who frequently use social media,
as well as the impacts this usage has on their mental health, based on the findings of recent studies from the last decade. 
Another significant goal was to present the applications of social media in the field of health and nursing. 
The results of empirical studies show that frequent use of social media is often associated with problematic
conditions such as low self-esteem and depression, excessive anxiety about body image, excessive concern 
for timely information on events and situations, and negative social comparisons.In the health and nursing sector,
social media usage primarily aims at the transmission and exchange of information on health issues, as well as
facilitating the dissemination of emotional support and care.
